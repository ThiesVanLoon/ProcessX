    v1.2
	Added algorithms:
	- Snap Line-Vertices to nearest Points by Condition
    v1.1.2
	Improvements:
	- Completely reworked Create Nested Grid algorithm (fixed bugs, added new features: choose x and y factor for subgrids yourself, choose which grid lies on top)
    v1.1.1 
	Improvements:
	- Fixed progress indicator for Create Nested Grid algorithm
    v1.1 
	Improvements:
	- Added second condition to conditional algorithms, allowing e.g. BETWEEN operations
	- Added order by clause to some algorithms
	- Improved efficiency of some algorithms
	- Removed NOT operator from conditional algorithms as it cannot be used for comparisions; Use IS NOT instead
	- Some minor and general improvements
	Added algorithms:
	- Create Nested Grid
	- Count Points in Polygons with Condition
    v1.0 Initial Release. 
	Added algorithms: 
	- OpenTripPlanner Routes
	- OpenTripPlanner Traveltime
	- Conditional Intersection
	- Count Features in Features with Condition
	- Join attributes by nearest with Condition
	- Select possible duplicate features by similarity
	- Create Timepolygons with Pointcount
	- New Layer from GeoJSON String
