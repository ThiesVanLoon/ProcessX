    1.1 Improvements:
	- Added second condition to conditional algorithms, allowing e.g. BETWEEN operations.
	- Added order by clause to some algorithms
	- Improved efficiency of some algorithms
	- Removed NOT operator from conditional algorithms as it cannot be used for comparisions; Use IS NOT instead
	- Some minor and general improvements
	Added algorithms:
	- Create Nested Grid
	- Count Points in Polygons with Condition
    1.0 Initial Release. 
	Added algorithms: 
	- OpenTripPlanner Routes
	- OpenTripPlanner Traveltime
	- Conditional Intersection
	- Count Features in Features with Condition
	- Join attributes by nearest with Condition
	- Select possible duplicate features by similarity
	- Create Timepolygons with Pointcount
	- New Layer from GeoJSON String
